This project is a discord bot that i created back in 2020 to help manage a minecraft game comunity.


This bot is able of querying a MYSQL database , sending embeds, private messages.

All code is located in index.js

Users with lemaID ( owner ) could use the command -dizer (message) to make the bot talk on its own. 

I replaced the details of the database for temporary ones since i am still using that database for other personal projects.
You are free to change the code and use it as your own :).
